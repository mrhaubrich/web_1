    <h2>Welcome to myPod</h2>
    <span>
      Welcome to the place to show off your iPod, wherever you might be. Wanna
      join the fun? All you need is any iPod, from the early classic iPod to the
      latest iPod Nano, the smallest iPod Shuffle to the largest iPod Photo, and
      a digital camera. Just take a snapshot of your iPod in your favorite
      location and we'll be glad to post it on myPod. So, what are you waiting
      for?

    <h2>Seattle, Washington</h2>

      You can't see the 628 coffee shops.
